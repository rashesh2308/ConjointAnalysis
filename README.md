# ANALYSIS OF SMARTPHONE PREFERENCES

## INTRODUCTION

There are numerous smartphones available out there in the market. These devices are no longer used just for making phone calls and messaging; as a result, people tend to choose a smartphone according to their needs.  
Having domain knowledge is the key element to solve any business problem. We discussed about various factors affecting the purchase of smartphones, asked few retailers about their expert advice.  
We asked suggestions on the below factors from experts, in order to get advice on what customers would prefer:  
1. **Phone Brand** (Apple, Samsung, LG, Other)  
2. **Battery Life** (<12h, >13h)  
3. **Unlock Feature** (Face, Fingerprint)  
4. **Camera** (Excellent/Professional, Good, Average)  
5. **Price Range** (<=500, 501-1000, >=100)  
6. **Storage**(64GB, 128GB, 256GB+)  
7. **Preferred Purchase Type** (Instore, Online)  
8. **Display Size** (Small, Medium, Large)  
9. **Mode of Charging** (Wireless, Wired)  
10. **RAM** (6GB, 8GB, 12GB)  
11. **Color** (Black, Gray, Other)  

According to, Counterpoint, a global industry analysis firm, **Apple** dominates the highest market share with 46% in the US and **Samsung** rules at 27%. Other companies such as LG, OnePlus, Lenovo, etc. combined have a 27% market share.  
For our analysis, our target audience is **students and professionals** between the **age of 18 to 30**, since **94% of people** between that age range have smartphones.  
Below are the factors and the reasoning on narrowing down to 4 factors for our analysis after talking to retail experts and deciding among ourselves-  
1. **Preferred OS:** iOS and Android are the most popular OSs. Here, we chose preferred OS instead of preferred brand. This is to narrow down the levels as brand can have numerous levels since we have multiple brands in the market.  
2. **Unlock Feature:** Price of a phone depends on the unlocking feature. Face unlocking smartphones are usually costlier than just Fingerprint unlocks  
3. **Price Range:** Price is a deciding factor while choosing a new smartphone  
4. **Storage:** Even though cloud storages are popular, people tend to prefer having a good amount of internal storage

# Key Results on Conjoint Analysis
Since the first level of each attribute is specified to be 0 (a1=0 in options of Conjoint analysis),
the results of the conjoint analysis demonstrate the following:
• **Android** is defined to be preferred over iOS, with iOS’s average part-worth is -0.085
• **Fingerprint unlock feature** is preferred over Face unlock feature on an average, with the part-worth of 0.169 for Fingerprint unlock feature
• **Price below $500** is preferred over price ranges $501-$1000 and above $1001. Price below $500 has an average part-worth of 0.247 and price above $1001 has an average part-worth of -0.575.
• **Storage 128GB** is preferred over storages 64GB and 256GB on an average. Storage of 128GB has a part-worth of 0.153 and storage 256GB has a part-worth of -0.108.

From the results mentioned above we can conclude that **Profile 3 – Android, Fingerprint unlock feature, Price below $500, Storage 128GB – is the most preferred** set of characteristics for 100 people we interviewed for smartphones.   
**The least preferred profile is Profile 10 – OS-iOS, Face unlock feature, Price above $1001, Storage 256 GB.**  
From the importance of analysed attributes, **storage is defined to be the most important factor** to influence the choice of the customers (36.766%), the price is second most important (33.476%), while OS and unlock feature are 18.277% and 11.481% respectively.

  This tool helps us to project a market share for a new product or a brand with a competitive set of other brands or products. This table will assist a manager or a company in the market simulation process to derive a combination of different attributes which will provide an estimate of the market share of various competitive brands or products.
Let’s assume that **Product 4 here is the new hypothetical product** which we plan to launch. Below we have attached tables and graphs showing the market share of the above-mentioned products.

Product 1 which consists of an Android operating system, fingerprint unlock, a 64 GB storage, and a price range of $500 - $1000 is the most preferred. It has a market share of 44% whereas product 2 is least preferred by the individuals. Product 4 which we intend to launch has managed to achieve the second highest market share at 28%.

• **What if scenario** – While playing with product 4 which is to be launched and running the analysis with different factor combinations, we found that offering the following configurations to our target customers would increase the market share of Product 4 from 28% to 33%:
1. iOS operating system
2. Fingerprint unlock
3. Price less than $500
4. 256GB storage space

  After changing the price factor to less than $500 for product 4, the third individual started preferring product 4 and in the same way, many of the individuals ( shown in the excel sheet of Market Simulation) selected product 4 which led to an increase in its market share to 33%.
